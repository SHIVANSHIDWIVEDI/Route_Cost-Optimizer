# 🚌 Bus Route Cost Optimizer
# Description :

This is a simple yet powerful web application that helps users calculate the minimum cost of traveling between bus stations using regular and express routes.
The app takes three inputs :
🚏 Regular Route Costs – cost of traveling between consecutive stations on the regular route.
🚄 Express Route Costs – cost of traveling between consecutive stations on the express route.
💸 Express Transfer Cost – additional cost when switching from a regular to an express route.

It uses a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the cheapest cost to reach each station step-by-step, allowing for transfers between routes as needed.
The final result shows the minimum cumulative cost to reach each station from the starting point (station 0).
